pub mod middleware; // Proxy middleware
```

**Features:**
- HTTP/HTTPS load balancing
- Multiple algorithms (round-robin, least-connections, IP hash)
- Health checking with configurable intervals
- SSL termination with SNI support
- WebSocket proxying

### 4.2 Configuration
```toml
# Example proxy configuration
[[proxy.upstreams]]
name = "api-servers"
strategy = "round_robin"
health_check = { path = "/health", interval = "30s" }

[[proxy.upstreams.servers]]
address = "127.0.0.1:3001"
weight = 1

[[proxy.upstreams.servers]]
address = "127.0.0.1:3002"
weight = 2

[[proxy.routes]]
path = "/api/*"
upstream = "api-servers"
```

## Phase 5: Container Management (Week 5-6)

### 5.1 Container Integration (`crates/containers/`)
```rust
// Container management
pub mod docker;     // Docker API client
pub mod lifecycle;  // Container lifecycle
pub mod network;    // Network management
pub mod security;   // Security policies
```

**Capabilities:**
- Docker/Podman API integration
- Container creation, start, stop, remove
- Network isolation and port mapping
- Volume mounting and file sharing
- Resource limits (CPU, memory, disk)
- Security profiles and capabilities

### 5.2 Container API
```rust
// REST API for container management
POST   /api/containers              # Create container
GET    /api/containers              # List containers
GET    /api/containers/{id}         # Get container info
POST   /api/containers/{id}/start   # Start container
POST   /api/containers/{id}/stop    # Stop container
DELETE /api/containers/{id}         # Remove container
GET    /api/containers/{id}/logs    # Get container logs
```

## Phase 6: Async Job System (Week 6-7)

### 6.1 Job Queue (`crates/jobs/`)
```rust
// Job processing system
pub mod queue;      // Job queue implementation
pub mod worker;     // Job worker processes
pub mod sandbox;    // Container sandboxing
pub mod storage;    // File output management
```

**Job Flow:**
1. Job submitted via API with container image and parameters
2. Job queued in Redis/PostgreSQL with unique ID
3. Worker picks up job and creates isolated container
4. Container executes job and generates output files
5. Files stored securely with access controls
6. Job status updated and client notified

### 6.2 Job API
```rust
// Job management endpoints
POST   /api/jobs                   # Submit new job
GET    /api/jobs                   # List jobs
GET    /api/jobs/{id}              # Get job status
POST   /api/jobs/{id}/cancel       # Cancel job
GET    /api/jobs/{id}/output       # Download output files
GET    /api/jobs/{id}/logs         # Get job logs
```
